# Bonyansystem Loaning Platform Project

## Overview

This project was undertaken for Bonyansystem, a prominent company in the telecommunications industry, known for its collaboration with Hamrah Aval, the largest telecom company and the primary Mobile Network Operator in Iran with over 49 million pre-paid customers.

### Project Objective

The main goal of the project was to design a comprehensive loaning platform for prepaid customers, leveraging loyalty and user activity. The platform allows customers to automatically receive credit or internet when they run out, with repayment required within a one-month timeframe and an associated interest rate (typically between 15 to 20 percent).

## Project Features

### Market Research

Conducted in-depth market research to identify key features impacting customer reliability. The focus was on minimizing the bad debt ratio by ensuring a high percentage of customers repay their loans.

### Customer Prediction Model

Implemented a customer prediction model using synthetic data and machine learning techniques. This model aids in identifying reliable customers, maximizing loan repayment rates.

### User Interface

Designed a user-friendly interface using Streamlit. The UI allows users to set a threshold for confidence in customer reliability, generating a CSV file of customers meeting the specified threshold. This facilitates easy identification of valid customers for loan approval.

### Linear Scoring System

Developed a linear scoring system to assess the probability of a new customer's reliability based on user activity. This scoring system assists in making informed decisions about loan approval for new customers.

## How to Use

1. **Market Research Findings:** Refer to the market research documentation to understand the key features influencing customer reliability.

2. **Customer Prediction Model:** Utilize the provided machine learning models to predict customer reliability based on synthetic data.

3. **User Interface:** Access the user interface via Streamlit to set reliability thresholds and generate CSV files of valid customers for loan approval.

4. **Linear Scoring System:** Implement the linear scoring system to assess the probability of reliability for new customers.
